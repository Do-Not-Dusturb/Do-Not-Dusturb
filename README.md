# Do-Not-Dusturb

## About Me
Hi, I'm a guy that codes for fun. I'm helping nintendoboi22 because I'm bored. I'm in 8th grade, I do touch grass so don't worry. I know HTML, some JS, CSS (bro my CSS lookin ugly as hail ðŸ˜­), and some Python. I also make games on Scratch, so check that out: [My Scratch Profile](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Do_Not_Dusturb/). Also when I made my scratch account I originaly wanted the username to be do_not_DISTURB but it was taken so I did do_not_dusturb and it kinda stuck with me.

also my discord is King_Hades_
